I need to deploy flux (a web app) on the akash network using cloudmos and nix for reproducible builds

To deploy a web app like Flux on the Akash Network using Cloudmos and Nix for reproducible builds, follow these steps:

Create a Nix expression for your web app
First, you need to create a Nix expression for your web app. This expression will define all the dependencies and build instructions. Create a file named default.nix in your project root directory and define the expression for your web app:

nix
Copy
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

let
  flux = pkgs.callPackage ./flux.nix {};
in
  flux
Next, create a flux.nix file in your project root directory and specify the dependencies and build instructions:

nix
Copy
{ stdenv, fetchFromGitHub, nodejs, python3 }:

stdenv.mkDerivation rec {
  pname = "flux";
  version = "1.0.0";

  src = fetchFromGitHub {
    owner = "<your-github-username>";
    repo = "<your-repo-name>";
    rev = "v${version}";
    sha256 = "<your-src-sha256>";
  };

  buildInputs = [ nodejs python3 ];

  buildPhase = ''
    npm install
    npm run build
  '';

  installPhase = ''
    mkdir -p $out
    cp -R dist/ $out
  '';

  meta = with stdenv.lib; {
    description = "Flux - A Web App";
    homepage = "https://github.com/<your-github-username>/<your-repo-name>";
    license = licenses.mit;
    platforms = platforms.linux;
  };
}
Replace <your-github-username>, <your-repo-name>, and <your-src-sha256> with appropriate values.

Create a Cloudmos deployment configuration
Create a cloudmos.yaml file in the project root directory with the following content:

yaml
Copy
version: "1.0"
services:
  flux:
    image: "<your-docker-image>"
    deploy:
      resources:
        cpu: "100m"
        memory: "128Mi"
        storage: "1Gi"
    expose:
      - port: 80
        as: 80
        to: "internet"
Replace <your-docker-image> with the Docker image that you will create in the next step.

Create a Dockerfile
Create a Dockerfile in the project root directory for building the Docker image:

dockerfile
Copy
FROM nixos/nix

COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app

RUN nix-build default.nix -A package --out-link /nix/store/app
RUN cp -R /nix/store/app/dist /app

CMD nix-shell --run 'python3 -m http.server 80 --directory /app/dist'
Build and push the Docker image
Build your Docker image and push it to a container registry. Replace <your-docker-image> with the appropriate image name:

bash
Copy
docker build -t <your-docker-image> .
docker push <your-docker-image>
Deploy your app to the Akash Network
Now you can deploy your app to the Akash Network. First, install and set up the Akash CLI.

After setting up the Akash CLI, execute the following commands to deploy your app:

bash
Copy
akash tx deployment create ./cloudmos.yaml --from <your-wallet-name> --chain-id <akash-chain-id> --fees 5000uakt -y
Replace <your-wallet-name> with your wallet's name, and <akash-chain-id> with the appropriate chain ID.

After your deployment is created, you'll need to find an appropriate provider and create a lease:

bash
Copy
akash query market lease list --owner <your-wallet-address> --state active
Replace <your-wallet-address> with your wallet's address.

Finally, send a manifest to the provider:

bash
Copy
akash provider send-manifest ./cloudmos.yaml --dseq <deployment-sequence> --provider <provider-uri> --home ~/.akash --chain-id <akash-chain-id>
Replace <deployment-sequence> with the deployment sequence number and <provider-uri> with the provider's URI.

Now your Flux web app should be deployed on the Akash Network using Cloudmos and Nix for reproducible builds.

    deploy:
      resources:
        cpu: "100m"
        memory: "128Mi"
        storage: "1Gi"
    expose:
      - port: 3000
        as: 80
        to: "internet"
Replace <your-docker-image> with the Docker image that you will create in the next step.

Create a Dockerfile
Create a Dockerfile in the project root directory for building the Docker image:

dockerfile
Copy
FROM nixos/nix

COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app

RUN nix-build default.nix -A package --out-link /nix/store/app
RUN cp -R /nix/store/app/dist /app

CMD nix-shell --run 'npm run serve'
Build and push the Docker image
Build your Docker image and push it to a container registry. Replace <your-docker-image> with the appropriate image name:

bash
Copy
docker build -t <your-docker-image> .
docker push <your-docker-image>
Deploy your app to the Akash Network
Follow the instructions from the previous answer to deploy your app to the Akash Network.

Now, the Flux web app should be deployed on the Akash Network using Cloudmos and Nix for reproducible builds.

have you heard of cloudmos?

I apologize for the confusion in my previous responses. As of my knowledge cutoff date in September 2021, I am not aware of a tool or service called "Cloudmos." It is possible that it has been introduced since then, or I may have misunderstood your request.

If "Cloudmos" refers to a specific tool or service, please provide more information or context, and I will try my best to help you with deploying the Flux web app on the Akash Network.

cloudmos is a tool for deploying on akash. I think they need an sdl file. Here is a copy of the website:

I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. Now that you have provided more context about Cloudmos, I understand that it is a tool for deploying applications on the Akash Network. Cloudmos uses an SDL (Stack Definition Language) file, typically named deploy.yaml, to describe the deployment configuration.

To deploy the Flux app using Cloudmos, follow these steps:

Create a Dockerfile for the Flux app
In the project root directory, create a Dockerfile with the following content:

dockerfile
Copy
FROM node:16

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .

RUN npm ci
RUN npm run build

EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "run", "serve"]
Build and push the Docker image
Build your Docker image and push it to a container registry. Replace <your-docker-image> with the appropriate image name:

bash
Copy
docker build -t <your-docker-image> .
docker push <your-docker-image>
Create a deploy.yaml file
Create a deploy.yaml file in the project root directory with the following content:

yaml
Copy
version: "2.0"

services:
  web:
    image: <your-docker-image>
    expose:
      - port: 3000
        as: 80
        to: internet

profiles:
  compute:
    web:
      resources:
        cpu: "100m"
        memory: "128Mi"
        storage: "1Gi"

deployment:
  web:
    web:
      profile: web
      count: 1
Replace <your-docker-image> with the Docker image you created in step 2.

Deploy your app using Cloudmos
Visit the Cloudmos website.
Click "Choose Template" and then "Upload SDL."
Upload your deploy.yaml file.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the deployment process.
Now, the Flux web app should be deployed on the Akash Network using Cloudmos.

Based on the logs you provided, it seems like the Flux pod is experiencing issues with restarting the flux container. We need more information to diagnose the exact cause of the problem.

Please try the following steps to gather more information:

Check the detailed pod logs
Get the logs of the failed container to identify the problem. Replace <your-pod-name> with the name of the Flux pod:

bash
Copy
kubectl logs <your-pod-name> -c flux --previous
Check the pod description
Get the description of the pod, which may provide additional information about the issue:

bash
Copy
kubectl describe pod <your-pod-name>
Once you have more information from the logs and pod description, you can identify the root cause of the problem and proceed with a solution. If you are unsure how to interpret the information or need further assistance, feel free to share the logs and pod description here, and I'll be happy to help.

Welcome to the Akash Network! 🚀☁
This file is called a Stack Definition Laguage (SDL)
SDL is a human friendly data standard for declaring deployment attributes.
The SDL file is a "form" to request resources from the Network.
SDL is compatible with the YAML standard and similar to Docker Compose files.
Indicates version of Akash configuration file. Currently only "2.0" is accepted.
version: "2.0"

The top-level services entry contains a map of workloads to be ran on the Akash deployment. Each key is a service name; values are a map containing the following keys:
https://docs.akash.network/intro-to-akash/stack-definition-language#services
services:

The name of the service "web"
web:
# The docker container image with version. You must specify a version, the "latest" tag doesn't work.

# You can map ports here https://docs.akash.network/intro-to-akash/stack-definition-language#services.expose
expose:
- port: 3000
as: 80
to:
- global: true

The profiles section contains named compute and placement profiles to be used in the deployment.
https://docs.akash.network/intro-to-akash/stack-definition-language#profiles
profiles:

profiles.compute is map of named compute profiles. Each profile specifies compute resources to be leased for each service instance uses uses the profile.

Thank you for providing the deploy.yaml file. It appears to be a configuration for deploying a simple web application built with the Akashlytics/hello-akash-world image. This configuration will deploy a single instance of the web service using a compute profile with 0.5 CPU units, 512Mi of memory, and 512Mi of storage. The service will expose port 3000 as port 80, and it will be globally accessible.

However, this configuration does not seem to be related to the Flux app from your previous question or the logs you provided. If you are experiencing issues with the Flux app deployment, I recommend following the steps in my previous response to create a Dockerfile and deploy.yaml file for the Flux app, and then deploying it using Cloudmos or the Akash CLI.

If you need help with this specific configuration or have any other questions, please let me know, and I'd be happy to assist.

I deployed this test file how can I view the simple web app ?

To view the simple web app deployed on the Akash Network, you'll need to obtain the URL assigned to your deployment.

Find the lease:
After successfully deploying the app, you should have an active lease. You can list your leases using the Akash CLI:

bash
Copy
akash query market lease list --owner <your-akash-address> --state active
Replace <your-akash-address> with your Akash address. You should see an output similar to the following:

dts
Copy
leases:
- created_at: "..."
  escrow_payment:
    account_id: "..."
  lease_id:
    dseq: "..."
    gseq: "..."
    oseq: "..."
    owner: <your-akash-address>
    provider: <provider-address>
  price:
    amount: "..."
    denom: "..."
  state: "active"
Take note of the values for dseq and provider.

Obtain the deployment URL:
To get the deployment URL, use the following command:

bash
Copy
akash provider send-manifest <provider-address> --home <your-akash-home-directory> --node <your-akash-node-url> --dseq <deployment-sequence>
Replace the placeholders with the appropriate values:

<provider-address>: The provider address from the previous step.
<your-akash-home-directory>: Your local Akash home directory. It's usually located at ~/.akash.
<your-akash-node-url>: The URL of the Akash node you are using. For example, https://rpc.akash.forbole.com:443.
<deployment-sequence>: The deployment sequence (dseq) from the previous step.
The command will return a JSON object containing the deployment URL. Look for the host field in the services section:

json
Copy
{
  "services": [
    {
      "name": "web",
      "available": 1,
      "total": 1,
      "uris": [
        "<your-deployment-url>"
      ],
      "observed_generation": 1,
      "replicas": 1,
      "updated_replicas": 1,
      "ready_replicas": 1,
      "available_replicas": 1
    }
  ],
  "forwarded_ports": {}
}
Access the web app:
Copy the <your-deployment-url> value from the previous step and paste it into your web browser. You should now see the simple web app running on the Akash Network.

how can I change the url on the lease to my custom url

To use a custom domain for your deployment on the Akash Network, you'll need to configure a CNAME record in your domain's DNS settings. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Obtain the deployment URL:
Follow the steps provided in my previous response to get the deployment URL for your app (e.g., <your-deployment-url>).

Configure a CNAME record:
Go to your domain registrar or DNS provider and create a new CNAME record for your custom domain. The exact steps may vary depending on your provider. In general, you'll need to:

Choose the desired subdomain (e.g., app.yourdomain.com).
Set the record type to CNAME.
Set the target or value to the deployment URL you obtained in step 1 (e.g., <your-deployment-url>).
Save the new DNS record.
Wait for DNS propagation:
DNS changes can take some time to propagate across the internet. It could take anywhere from a few minutes to a couple of hours, depending on your DNS provider and other factors. You can check the DNS propagation status using online tools like DNS Checker.

Access the web app using your custom domain:
Once the DNS changes have propagated, you should be able to access your app on the Akash Network using your custom domain (e.g., app.yourdomain.com). Enter your custom domain into your web browser to view the app.

Keep in mind that if you want to use HTTPS for your custom domain, you'll need to set up an SSL/TLS certificate for it. You can use a service like Let's Encrypt to obtain a free SSL certificate and then configure it in your web server or reverse proxy.

I need to isntall git on this machine

To install Git on your machine, follow the instructions based on your operating system:

For macOS:

You can install Git using the Homebrew package manager. If you don't have Homebrew installed, follow the instructions at brew.sh to install it. Then, run the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy
brew install git
For Windows:

You can download the Git installer for Windows from the official Git website. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

Alternatively, you can use Git for Windows which includes Git BASH, a terminal emulator that provides Git command-line features.

For Linux (Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions):

Open a terminal and run the following command to update your package list and install Git:

bash
Copy
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
For Linux (Fedora-based distributions):

Open a terminal and run the following command to install Git:

bash
Copy
sudo dnf install git
For Linux (Arch-based distributions):

Open a terminal and run the following command to install Git:

bash
Copy
sudo pacman -S git
After installing Git, you can verify the installation by running:

bash
Copy
git --version
This command should display the installed Git version.

i meant install it on the akash server that I sent you the SDL file for

To install Git on the Akash server with the provided SDL file, you need to create a custom Docker image with Git installed. Here's how to do it:

Create a Dockerfile:
Create a new file named Dockerfile in a directory on your local machine with the following content:

dockerfile
Copy
# Base image
FROM akashlytics/hello-akash-world:0.2.0

# Install Git
USER root
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y git

# Switch back to the default user
USER node
This Dockerfile starts with the akashlytics/hello-akash-world:0.2.0 image and installs Git on top of it.

Build the custom Docker image:
In the same directory as your Dockerfile, run the following command to build the custom Docker image:

bash
Copy
docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/hello-akash-world-git:0.1.0 .
Replace your-dockerhub-username with your Docker Hub username. This command will create a new image named hello-akash-world-git with the tag 0.1.0.

Push the custom Docker image to Docker Hub:
First, log in to Docker Hub using the following command (if you haven't already):

bash
Copy
docker login
Next, push the custom Docker image to your Docker Hub repository:

bash
Copy
docker push your-dockerhub-username/hello-akash-world-git:0.1.0
Replace your-dockerhub-username with your Docker Hub username.

Update the SDL file:
Modify the deploy.yaml SDL file by changing the image field in the services section to use the custom Docker image you just created:

yaml
Copy
services:
  web:
    image: your-dockerhub-username/hello-akash-world-git:0.1.0
    ...
Replace your-dockerhub-username with your Docker Hub username.

Redeploy your application on Akash:
Now that the SDL file is updated, you can redeploy your application on Akash using the updated deploy.yaml. Follow the steps to create and send a deployment using the Akash CLI or Cloudmos.

Once your application is redeployed, Git will be installed on the Akash server.

here is the dployment:

The updated args section now includes apt-get install git -y ; to install Git on the server.

Redeploy your application on Akash using the updated deploy.yaml file. Once your application is redeployed, Git will be installed on the Akash server.

I need ton run:
git clone https://github.com/transmissions11/flux.git
cd flux
npm install
npm run dev

To run the given commands on the Akash server, you need to first update the SDL file to include the installation of Node.js and npm, then clone the repository and run the specified commands. Here's the updated deployment file:

Clone the Git repository and run the specified commands with git clone https://github.com/transmissions11/flux.git ;, cd flux ;, npm install ;, and npm run dev ;.
Redeploy your application on Akash using the updated deploy.yaml file. Once your application is redeployed, Node.js, npm, and Git will be installed, and the specified commands will be executed on the Akash server.

for some reason that breaks my shell conection

It seems that the issue might be caused by running the npm run dev command in the same shell, blocking the shell from accepting additional input. To fix this, you can run the npm run dev command in the background using the & operator.

Here's the updated deployment file:

With the updated args section, npm run dev is now executed in the background using npm run dev & ;. This should allow the shell to stay interactive and accept additional input.

Redeploy your application on Akash using the updated deploy.yaml file. Once your application is redeployed, you should be able to establish a shell connection without issues.

It seems that there are a few issues occurring with your application. Let's break down the problems:

Ephemeral storage limit exceeded: The application's container is exceeding its local ephemeral storage limit of 1073741824 bytes (1 GiB). This can be caused by the application writing too much data to its ephemeral storage or not cleaning up temporary files.

Back-off restarting failed container: The application is experiencing issues that cause it to fail repeatedly, leading to Kubernetes restarting the container with a back-off period. This is likely related to the storage limit issue mentioned above.

To resolve these issues, you can try the following:

Investigate storage usage: Check your application's code and identify any areas where it may be writing excessive data to the ephemeral storage. This could include logs, temporary files, or caches. If you find any areas of concern, try to optimize the storage usage or clean up unnecessary data periodically.

Increase ephemeral storage limit: If your application genuinely requires more storage, you can increase the ephemeral storage limit for the container. To do this, update the container's resource limits in the Kubernetes deployment configuration:

yaml
Copy
resources:
  limits:
    ephemeral-storage: "2Gi" # Increase the limit as needed
```

Use persistent storage: If your application needs to store data persistently or requires a larger storage capacity, consider using a persistent storage solution like a Persistent Volume (PV) and Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) in Kubernetes. This will allow your application to store data outside of the container's ephemeral storage.

Once you've made the necessary changes, redeploy your application and monitor the logs again to see if the issues are resolved.

give me the full file

It looks like you are using a Kubernetes deployment configuration for your application. Here's an example of a full deployment YAML file, which includes the modifications I mentioned earlier to address the issues you're experiencing:

yaml
Copy
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app-container
        image: ubuntu:latest
        resources:
          limits:
            ephemeral-storage: "2Gi" # Increase the ephemeral storage limit as needed
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
      volumes:
      - name: app-persistent-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: app-pvc
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: app-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi # Modify the storage size as needed
This example assumes that you have a valid Persistent Volume available in your cluster with sufficient storage capacity. The YAML file contains two parts: the first part is the Deployment configuration, and the second part is a PersistentVolumeClaim configuration to request persistent storage for your application.

You'll need to modify the configuration to match your specific application needs, such as the container image, ports, and other settings. Once you've customized the configuration, you can apply it using kubectl:

sh
Copy
kubectl apply -f your_deployment_file.yaml
Don't forget to replace your_deployment_file.yaml with the name of the file containing your deployment configuration.

Please note that this example assumes you are using a single container in your pod. If your application uses multiple containers, you might need to adapt the configuration accordingly.
